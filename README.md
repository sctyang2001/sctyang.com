# Home Page of Scottie Yang
Update Oct 21, 2022

Thank you and welcome to the first Web project, the personal home page of Scottie.
(To visit my website, please go to https://www.sctyang.com/)

I started off by learning some web structure including DNS, TCP/IP, CNAME... I got
the .com domain at namecheap.com and manually set it up to GitHub Hosting service.

I made this homepage practicing using basic structure of HTML for my index page and CSS, 
JS for many other subfunctions. After I got familiar with it, I practiced to deploy some vendors like 
BootStrap, Typed.js and swiper. I am adding more blogs to the blog function. Of course, my 
next step is to learn to use the server instead of Github hosting and update it using 
React.js which I am learning now.

I house most of the information in "index.html" while all setup code and apperence backup
are housed in /assets/. You can find my CSS code in /assets/css/ and JS code in assets/js/. 
All of the pictures I used could be found at /assets/img/
